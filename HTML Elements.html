        <!-- Nested HTML Elements HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
        All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
        The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):    -->
        <h1>First Element <p>Nested HTML Elements HTML elements</p></h1>

        <!-- Empty HTML Elements HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
        The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag: -->
        <p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

        <!-- The style Attribute :
        The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more. -->
        <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

        <!-- HTML Horizontal Rules
        The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
        The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page: -->
        <hr>

        <!-- The HTML <pre> Element
        The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
        The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks: -->
        <pre>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

        My Bonnie lies over the sea.

        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

        Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
        </pre>

        <!-- The title Attribute
        The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
        The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element: -->
        <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
<!-- HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML. -->
